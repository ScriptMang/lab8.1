## Where AI saved time.
 * AI helped me setting up the boilerplate for my HTML page. 
## At least one AI bug you identified and how you fixed it
 * AI when given a general prompt went overboard with features.
   I had a hard time seraching for bugs I know existed. I had to ask it to scale down the scope of the code it generated just to be able to follow it. It felt like every piece of code generated was a merge request. I had to scrutinize everything.
## A code snippet you refactored for clarity
 * I asked AI to generate a feature to save a deck of card but then it
   it removed the ability to delete the cards individually. I had to tell it to add it back.
## One accessibility improvement you added.
 * I asked it to help me add aria labels to my buttons.
## What prompt changes improved AI output.
 *  I told AI to make the project simple. Although some of the features from
    the lab weren't initally added, it made the code easier to follow. I knew what the code was doing which allowed me to make more prompts to build on it. I think past 300 lines of code is where I would prompt it to break down code into separate additions. I still want to understand what its doing.
